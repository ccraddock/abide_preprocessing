\section{Supplementary Information (optional)}

Names and short legends for each supporting file.  Supplementary Information may include code and workflows, media content (images, videos, etc.), and any other files required to support the data description or to help others reuse the data.  In principle, primary data files should be stored in an external data repository, not the Supplementary Information section.  In most cases, the Supplementary Information should not contain text documents or supplemental figures â€“ all textual information and figures that are central to the Data Descriptor should be included in the main document. The Methods, Technical Validation, and Usage Notes sections are all of unrestricted length.
