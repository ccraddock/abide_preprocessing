The abstract should succinctly describe the study, the assay(s) performed, the resulting data, and the reuse potential, but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings.  No references are allowed in this section.

 Grass-roots initiatives such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP)
		    and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI)[1] are
successfully amassing and sharing large-scale brain imaging datasets, with the
goal of recruiting the broader scientific community into the fold of
neuroimaging research. Unfortunately, despite the increasing breadth and scale
of openly available data, the vast domain-specific knowledge and computational
resources necessary to derive scientifically meaningful information from
unprocessed neuroimaging data has limited their accessibility. The Neuro Bureau
Preprocessing Initiative [2] has taken on this challenge,
generating and openly sharing preprocessed data and common derivatives for the
large-scale ADHD-200 dataset [3,7]. This initiative has grown to
include preprocessed DTI data and derivatives for 180 healthy individuals from
INDI's Beijing Enhanced Sample [4]. The next planned release will
include resting state and structural data from the 1,112 subject Autism Brain
Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset [5].
