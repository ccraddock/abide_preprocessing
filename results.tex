\section{Methods}
This section should include detailed text describing the methods used in the study and assay(s), and the processing steps leading to the production of the data files, including any computational analyses (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). These methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the study and assay(s).  Authors are encouraged to cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the methods descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications.  In principle, fundamentally new methods should not be presented for the first time in Data Descriptors, and we may choose to decline publication of a Data Descriptor until any novel methods or techniques are published in an appropriate research or methods-focused journal article.
