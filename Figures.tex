\section{Figures (optional)}

Figure images should be provided as separate files and should be referred to using a consistent numbering scheme through the entire Data Descriptor.  In most cases, a Data Descriptor should not contain more than three figures, but more may be allowed when needed.  We discourage the inclusion of figures in the Supplementary Information â€“ all key figures should be included here in the main Figure section.  

For initial submissions, authors may choose to supply this document as a single PDF with embedded figures.
