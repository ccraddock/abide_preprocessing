An overview of the study design, the assay(s) performed, and the created data, including any background information needed to put this study in the context of previous work and the literature. The section should also briefly outline the broader goals that motivated the creation of this dataset and the potential reuse value.  This section should include citations to the literature as needed.  We also encourage authors to include a figure that provides a schematic overview of the study and assay(s) design.
